### Installing Python and VS code

We recommend opening this notebook with VS code. A handy guide for doing so is here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial   

For those that don't know, a Jupyter notebook is a convenient way of running python code, where code segments are seperated into "cells". It is then possible to run each cell one by one, usually it is good practice to start at the top and run each subsequent cell one by one. Variables are typically global i.e. variables defined in cells can be called in cells positioned below. 

The only prerequisite is that you can run the first cell in the notebook "Intro.ipynb". This checks the version of python you currently have installed. If you can run this successfully, then you should be able to run the rest of the notebook.
